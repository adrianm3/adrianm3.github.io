                    <p> During my time in grad school, my thesis was focused on the flame vapor synthesis of nanocrystalline diamonds in ambient pressure.
                        Here is a link to my research published with the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsanm.2c02059">American Chemical Society</a>.

                        My research was very hands on and I was able to use a lot of cool equipment such as SEM, FIB, AFM, and plasma chambers.
